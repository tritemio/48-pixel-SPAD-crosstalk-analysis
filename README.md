## Download results

View or download CSV data files generated by the analysis from the [results/](https://github.com/tritemio/48-pixel-SPAD-crosstalk-analysis/tree/master/results) folder.

## Download notebooks and raw data

Download the complete ZIP archive from [this link](https://github.com/tritemio/48-pixel-SPAD-crosstalk-analysis/archive/master.zip)
and extract it.

You also need to download two datasets from figshare and put them in the [data/](https://github.com/tritemio/48-pixel-SPAD-crosstalk-analysis/tree/master/data) folder.

## Re-run the analysis

Your need python 3.6+, FRETBursts 0.6.5+, phconvert 0.8+, pycorrelate 0.1.

You can recreate the original conda environment used for running this
analysis using the file `conda_environment_windows.yml`.
